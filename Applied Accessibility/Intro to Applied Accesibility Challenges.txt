Intro to Applied Accessibility Challenges

1. Accessibiliy
  -Generally means having web content and a user interface
  that can be understiid, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience.

  - MAIN IDEA: Websites should be open and accessible to everyone!
  Keeping the needs of various users in mind during development gies a long way towards creating an open web.

  - Includes people w/ visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.

  - Some users may rely on assistive technology (screen readers, voice recognition software etc...) while others may be able to navigate through a site using only a keyboard.

2. Learning Objectives/ Concepts:
  1. Have well organized code that uses the apprpriate markup
  2. Ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
  3. Creat an easily-navigated page that is keyboard friendly
