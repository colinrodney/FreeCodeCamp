Applied Accessibility: Know When Alt text should be left blank:

- Use of the alt attribute on images is mandatory per HTML5 specifications.

In instances when an images is already explained w/ text content, or the images doN't add any meaning to the page (ex: images grouped w/ a text caption or images that are for decoration)
the alt attribute is still required, but it can be set to an emplty string.

-Background images usually fall into the "decorative image" category and are usually applied via CSS rules and therefore are not a part of the markup processed by screen readers.

NOTE: For images w/ captions it is good to still use alt text as it helps search engines catalog the content of the image.

-MAIN IDEA:
  alt text - helps search engines catalog image content (SEO boost?)
  all images require use of alt attribute and alt text except for "decorative" images such as background images which are usually applied via CSS and not processed by screen readers.
