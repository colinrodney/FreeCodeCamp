Applied Accessibility: Wrap Content in the article Element:

Article:
  > Anotoher one of the new HTML5 elements that adds semantic
  meaning to your markup.

  > Used as a sectioning element
    - Used to wrap independent, self-container content.
    - Works we;; w/ blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.


-Determining whether content cant stand alone is usuallya judgement call, but there aee some questions that can be asked for testing:
1. If all srrounding content were removed, would that content still make sense?
2. Would the content hold up if it were text in an RSS feed?

REMEMBER: Assistive technology users rely on organized, semantically meaningful markup to better understand your work.

NOTE: re section and div:
  > section element is also new w/ HTML5 and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article.

    - An article is for standalone (independent) content.
    - A section is for grouping (thematically related) content.'
    - The two can be used within each other as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter in the book would be a section.
    -When there is no relationship between groups of content, we use a div.

    See: Guidance below:

    <div> - groups content
    <section> - groups related content<article> - groups independent, self contained
    content.
