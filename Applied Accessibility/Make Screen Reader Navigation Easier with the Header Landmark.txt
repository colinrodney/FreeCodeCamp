Header Tag
  - HTML5 element used to add semantic meaning + improve Accessibility
  - Used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag.
  - Works well for content that is repeated at the top on multiple pages.

  -Shares the embedded landmark feature we saw w/ <main>, which allows assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.

  NOTE: header element is to be used inside the body tag of the HTML document.
  This is different thatn the head element  that contains the page title, metadata etc...
