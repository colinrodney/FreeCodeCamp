Match Ending String Patterns

NOTES:
- @ the last challenge we learned how to use the caret character(^) to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. 
Matching Patterns at the End Of a String 



- There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings. We can search the end of strings using the dollar sign (anchor) character ($) at the end of the regex. For example:

	let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
	let storyRegex= /story$/;
	storyRegex.test(theEnding);

	let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
	storyRegex.test(noEnding);

	- the first test call will return true, while the second test call would return false.

NOTE:
Review differences between .test() and .match() methods!!




CHALLENGE SOLUTION CODE:

let caboose = "The last car on a train is the caboose";
let lastRegex = /caboose$/;
let result = lastRegex.test(caboose);
