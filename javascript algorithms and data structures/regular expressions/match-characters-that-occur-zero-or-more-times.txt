Matching Characters that Occur Zero or More Times within a string

NOTES:
- @ the last challenge we used the '+' sign to look for characters that occur one or more times.  We also have an option that will match characters that occur zero or more times.

The character used to match characters that occur zero or more times is the asterisk/ star * character. For Example:


	let soccerWord = "gooooooal!"
	let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
	let oPhrase = "over the moon";
	let goRegex = /go*/;


	soccerWord.match(goRegex) // returns ["gooooooal"]

	gPhrase.match(goRegex) // returns ["g"]

	oPhrase.match(goRegex) // returns null. This is because neither of the characters in the regular expression /go*/ appear within thestring.

	



CHALLENGE SOLUTION CODE
let chewieRegex = /Aa*/;

let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
//returns ["Aaaaaaaaaaa"]
