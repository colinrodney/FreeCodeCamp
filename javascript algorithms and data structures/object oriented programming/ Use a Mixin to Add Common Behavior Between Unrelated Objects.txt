Use a Mixin to Add Common Behavior Between Unrelated Objects

Skills/ Concepts introduced
- mixins


> Behavior is shared through inheritance. There are some cases when 
  inheritance is not the best solution.

    - inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects such as 'Bird' 
    and 'Airplane'. They both can fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane,
    and an Airplane is not a type of Bird.

    - For unrelated objects it is better to use mixins.

    > What is a mixin?
      - A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions. (??? Research mixins further),
      for example:

        let flyMixin = function(obj){
          obj.fly = function(){
            console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
          }
        };

        - the flyMixin takes some object and gives that object the 'fly' method.

        let bird = {
          name: "Donald",
          numLegs: 2,
        };

        let plane = {
          model: "777",
          numPassengers: 524,
        }

        flyMixin(bird);
        flyMixin(plane);

        - Here bird and plane are passed into the flyMixin function,
        which then assigns the fly function to each object passed in.
        Now both bird and plane have access to the 'fly' method and as 
        such, both bird and plane can call the fly method:

          bird.fly();
          plane.fly();

        The console would display the string "Flying, wooosh!" twice, that
        is one time for each of the method calls.

        Note how the mixin allows for the same fly method to be reused by
        the unrelated objects bird and plane.



CODE CHALLENGE:

Creat a mixin in named dlideMixin that defines a method named
glide. The use the glideMixin to give both bird and boat the ability
to glide.

Todo's:
  1. Create mixin name glideMixin
    a. Define a method named glide within the mixin
    b. Use the glideMixin to to give bird and boat access to the 
    glide method.

CHALLENGE SOLUTION CODE:

let bird ={
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2,
};

let boat = {
  name: "Warrior",
  type: "race-boat"
};

// Change code below this line...

let glideMixin = function(obj){
  obj.glide = function(){
    return "gliding",
  }
} 

glideMixin(bird);
glideMixin(boat);
