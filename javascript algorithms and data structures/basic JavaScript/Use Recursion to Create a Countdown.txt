Basic JavaScript: Use Recursion to Create a Countdown

Recursion Terminology:

base case:
  > Tells the recursive function when it no logner needs to call itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known.

recursive call:
  > Executes the original function with different arguments. If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.

  Challenge tools:
  > chk array methods .push() and others (w3 schools?)
