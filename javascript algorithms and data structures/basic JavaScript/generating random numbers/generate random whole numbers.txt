Problem:
Generate a random whole number between 0 and 9 using JavaScript.




Points to remeber: 
Math.random() can never quite return a 1. It will return a number between 0 and 0.9

TODO's
1. Generate a random decimal using the Math.random() function.

2. Multiply the random generated number by 10 to convert it to a whole number and store the result in a variable called roundedNumber.

3. Return the variable roundedNumber as a result.





Strategy:
Research
Execute:

1.Generate random decimal and multiply by 10 to convert.
Code:
let randomDecimal = Math.random()*10;

2. 
Use another function Math.floor() to round the variable randomNumber DOWN to its nearest whole number and return as result
Code:
return Math.floor(randomNumber);



SOLUTION CODE (Passes all tests):
function randomWholeNum() {

  // Only change code below this line
  let randomDecimal = Math.random()*10;
  return (Math.floor(randomDecimal));
}     

NOTE: There is more than one way to solve this problem!!
