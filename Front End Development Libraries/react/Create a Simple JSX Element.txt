Create a Simple JSX Element

> React
  - Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook.
  - Used to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications
  - Uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX which allows you
    to write HTML directly within JavaScript which has several benefits:

      - It allows you to use the full programming power of JavaScript
        within HTML.

      - Helps to keep your code readable and maintanable.

    - in general, JSX  is similar to the HTML you've already learned,
      but there are a few key differences that will be covered througout
      these challenges.

        - For example, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript,
          you can actually write JavaScript directly into JSX. To write
          JavaScript directly into JSX, simply inclide the code that needs
          to be treated as JavaScript inside curly braces {'This is treated 
          as JavaScript code' }. Kepp this in mind, since this syntax will 
          be used in several future code challenges.

        - Because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code has to be complied
        into JavaScript. 
          - A popular transpile - Babel is a popular tool for this process.
            - NOTE since Babel is already added behind the scenes for these
              challenges - if you write syntactically invalid JSX, the first
              test in these challenges will fail.

        - NOTE: Under the hood the challenges are calling:
          ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root')).
            - This function call is what places your JSx into React's own
            lightweight representation of the Document Object Model (DOM).
            -React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating
            only specific parts of the actual DOM.



CODE CHALLENGE:

Problem:
The current code uses JSX to assign a div element to the constant JSX. Replace the div with an h1 element and add the text Hello JSX! inside it.


Solution Code:
const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>;
