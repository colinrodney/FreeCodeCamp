Define an HTML Class in JSX

> How does JSX differ from HTML?
  -JSX and HTML seem to be the exact same thing. JSX and HTML are very similar but are not the same.

> Defining classes in JSX vs HTML
  - One key difference between JSX and HTML is how class names (classes) are defiend. 

  - IN JSX we cannot use the word 'class' to define an HTML class because the word 'class' is a reserved word in JavaScript. To declare an HTML class in JSX we use the word 'className'.

  -Naming conventions for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX are to be writted in camelCase. Consider the following examples:

    - a click event in JavaScript or HTML is written as 'onclick'.

    - a click event in JSX should be written as 'onClick'.

    - a change event in HTML or JavaScript is written as 'onchange'.

    - a change event in JSX should be written as 'onChange'.

CODE CHALLENGE:

- Goal: Apply a class of myDiv to the div provided in the JSX code.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION CODE + Explanation:

const JSX = (
  <div className = "myDiv">
    <h1>Ass a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);

  - To declare an HTML class attribute in JSX we cannot use the word 'class' as it is a JavaScript reserved word. Instead we have to do two things:

    1. Use the word 'className' to declare the HTML class attribute and...

    2. The JSX naming convetions for ALL HTML attributes and event references MUST be written in camelCase such that react can distinguish JSX from Javascript syntax. (???)
