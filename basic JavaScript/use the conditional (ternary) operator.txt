****Basic JavaScript: Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator

> The conditional/ "question mark" operator
  - also called the ternary operator
  - can be used as a one line if-else expression (shortcut)
  -Has three operands:
    1. The condition
    2. The "if true" value (executes if condition evaluates to true)
    3. The "if false" value (executes if condition evaluates to false)

  - The condition should evaluate to a boolean value true or false.

  SYNTAX:
    - condition ? expression-if-true : expression-if-false;
    -read as: " condition "the question is(?)" "expression true?" or(:) " expression false"


    Solution code:
    function checkEqual(a, b) {
    return a == b? "Equal":"Not Equal";
    }
    checkEqual(1, 2);


    ****Basic JavaScript: Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators
    Conditional operators can be chained together to check for multiple conditions.

    Ex:
    function findGreatrOrEqual(a,b){
      return (a == b) ? "Equal":
      (a > b) ? "a greater than b":
      "b greater than a";

      In using multiple ternary operators it is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators
      such that each condition is on its own seperate line as shown above. Using multiple ternary operators without 
      proper indentation will make your code hard to read.
