Basic JavaScript: Use the parseInt Function with a Radix

> parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer
and can also accept a second argument for the radix, which specifies
the base of the number in the string.

> The radix can be any integer between 2 and 36.
> The purpose of the radix is to CONVERT A
BINARY NUMBER TO AN INTEGER AND RETURN IT.

Example:
var a = parseInt("11", 2);

> radix variable says that "11" is in the binary system, otherbase 2.
The above example converts the string "11" to an integer 3.
