Basic JavaScript: Profile Lookup

Burning Questions:
What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation?
All of the code was setup properly but when using dot notation all tests failed. When used bracket notation all tests passed??

Problem/ Goal:
Function should chk if "name" is an actual contact's first name and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact

If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.

If name does not correspond to any contacts then return "no such contact".

If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return "no such property".
***********************************

Restate Problem:
Function will chk to see if value of "name" is indeed the first name of one of the contacts in the array of objects.

The function will also chk to see if the passed property (prop) is attached to the passed contact name.

if the name matches one of the names in the objects array and the property matches a property of that contact (name):
Return the VALUE of that property.

If the name does not match one of the names in the objects array:
Return: "no such contact"

If the passed property is not attached to any contact in the objects array:
Return: "no such property"


Discussion:
After reading, reading and re-reading , and seeking help- I approached this problem by working backwards:

State Problem: State Original Problem

Restate Problem:
For this problem the function needs chk if name is an actual contact's name (is the name found in the list at all? And if it is, is the property - represented by the variable prop associated w/ the matched name?

If the passed name (represented by variable name) is matched within the object array AND the passed property represented by the variable prop is associated w/ that name: We are to return the VALUE of the passed property.

If the passed proerty does not correspont to any contaccts within the object array we are to return "No such property"

What is the name is not at all in the object array?
return "No such contact".


MAIN IDEA OF THIS PROBLEM: 
Is that we will return a result if and only if certain specific conditions exist!
If the name is found within the object array AND the passed property is associated w/ that specific name: > we return "x" result.

If the name is found within the object array but the passed property is NOT at all associated to any of the names within the object array: > we return "y" result

If the name is not at all found within the object array: we return "z" result


Design + Strategy
Use a for loop to iterate the length of the objects array!

After setting up the loop we then begin asking logical questions about the conditions to setup our decision structure (if/then).



Discussion:
I prefer write my code very explicitly such that it reads almost identically to the problem. With that being said lets start w/ the "catch all" condition

Scenario 1.
 What if the name is not in the object array at all?
 If this is the case we can immediately return "No such contact".
(If the name is not in the object array at all it cannot be associated w/ anything in the object list)

Scenario 2:
We've addressed the "catch all" condition
lets begin working on the compound conditions
We are to return the value of the property if and only if both the name is matched to the object array AND the passed property is associated w/ that specific name:

>Discuss solution code here!<


Scenario 3:
Since I prefer to code as explicitly as possible I'm going to code the remainder of our solution as another compound conditional:

>Further discuss solution code here!<


TODOs:
1. 
(Name not found in object array at all)
Chk if the name passed in matches any first name in the objects array. If not - return "no such contact"

2.
(Name matched +  passed property matched to name) 
Chk if both the name passed in is found within the object array AND chk if that name is associated w/ the property which was passed in.
> If the matched name is associated w/ the property that was passed in:
- return the value of the property passed into the function

3.
(Name matched + passed property not matched to name)
> If the name is matched but it is not associated w/ the property passed into the function:
- return "No such property"


MASTER SOLUTION CODE:
function lookUpProfile(name, prop){
// Only change code below this line
for(let i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++){
    // contact name matched AND contact name is associated w/ property passed
    if(contacts[i].firstName == name && contacts[i].hasOwnProperty(prop)){
        return contacts[i][prop];
    // contact name matched And contact name is not assoc w/ property passed
    }else if(contacts[i].firstName == name && !contacts[i].hasOwnProperty(prop)){
        return "No such property";
    }
}
return "No such contact";
        
// Only change code above this line
}

lookUpProfile("Akira", "likes")
