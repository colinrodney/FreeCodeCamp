CSS Grid:
Create Flexible Layouts Using auto-Flexible

> The repeat() function can be used w/ an option called auto-fill
  > auto-fill 
    - Allows you to automatically insert as many rows or colums of your specified size as possible depending on the size of the container.

    -Flexible layouts can be created when combining auto-fill with minmax like this:
      repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px,1fr));

      -When the container size changes, auto-fill combine w/ minmax will continue to inser 60px columns and stretching them until it can insert another one.
      Note: If the container cannot fit all of the items on one row, it will move them down to a new one.
