CSS Grid: Create Flexible Layouts Using auto-fit

> auto-fit 
  - works almost identically to auto-fill except for one difference

> auto-fit vs auto-fill
  - auto-fill
      - when the container size is greater than the size of all
      of the items combined, auto-fill will keep inserting empty rows or columns and 
      will push your items to the side.

  -auto-fit:
      - when the container size is greater than the size of all of the items combined,
      auto-fit will collapse empty rows or columns and will stretch the items to fit 
      the size of the container.
      NOTE: if the container cannot fit all of the items on one row, it will move
      them down to a new one.
